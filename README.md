DriverPass Project Reflection

Project Summary
The DriverPass project was created for a client who wanted to improve student driving test preparation. Many students were failing their driving exams, and the client wanted a system that combined online practice exams with on-the-road training scheduling. The system needed to include customer accounts, scheduling functionality, payment processing, notifications, and integration with DMV updates.

What I Did Well
I feel I did particularly well in gathering and organizing the system requirements. I was able to clearly separate functional and nonfunctional requirements and design UML diagrams that represented different perspectives of the system. I also used plain language in my presentation materials, which helped me communicate system design to a nontechnical audience.

What I Would Revise
If I could revise one part of my work, I would revisit my UML activity diagrams. While they showed the main steps clearly, I could improve them by adding more detail on edge cases such as failed payments or unavailable lesson slots. This would make the diagrams more complete and practical for developers.

Interpreting User Needs
I interpreted user needs by closely reviewing the interview transcript and aligning each feature of the system to a specific request from the client. For example, the need for real-time scheduling and notifications was directly implemented in my system design. Considering the user’s needs is important because it ensures the final product solves the client’s actual problems, not just what the analyst thinks is important.

Design Approach
When designing software, I like to start with requirements gathering and then translate those into models such as use case diagrams and activity diagrams. These visualizations help ensure clarity before coding begins. In the future, I plan to use iterative design and prototyping more often, so that clients can see early versions of the system and provide feedback before the design is finalized.
